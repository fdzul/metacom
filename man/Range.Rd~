\title{
Determines species turnover
}

\description{
'Range' is a function that assesses species turnover from the community perspective. If the range perspective is desired, simply transpose the matrix before analysis using the transpose function ('t()').
}

\usage{
Range(matrix, method = "r1", sims = 1000, scores = 1)
}

%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{matrix}{
community data in the form of a presence absence matrix
}
  \item{method}{
null model randomization method used by 'nullmaker'. See details. 
}
  \item{sims}{
number of simulated null matrices to use in analysis
}
  \item{scores}{
Axis scores to ordinate matrix. 1: primary axis scores (default) 2: secondary axis scores
}
}
\details{
Method is an argument handed to functions in the 'vegan' package. Methods maintaining row (site) frequencies include 'r0','r1' \& 'r2'. The default is 'r1', which maintains row totals and fills columns according to their marginal probabilities. See the help file for 'commsimulator' or Wright et al. 1998 for more information. \\

This function can either be used as a standalone, or can be used through the 'main' function, which determines all 3 elemtns of metacommunity structure (coherence, boundary clumping, \& range turnover)

\value{
\item turnover: species turnover, quantified as the number of replacements across species ranges
\item z: the z statistic comparing observed turnover against species turnover of null matrices
\item pval: p-value from a z-test to assess significance of species turnover relative to null matrices
\item simulated mean: mean number of replacements in simulated null matrices
\item simulated variance: variance in the number of replacements of simulated null matrices
\item method: randomization method to create null matrices
