Minor update to one function argument. However, I no longer have access to the maintainer email address tdallas@ucdavis.edu. I have changed it to my permanent email tad.a.dallas@gmail.com. Sorry for not catching this before I lost access to the ucdavis account.

I have read and agree to the the CRAN policies at 
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html

Thanks!
